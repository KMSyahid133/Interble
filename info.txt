Intorduction:
    This is a esolang that doesn't work with lines, but with order code. 
    
    Example:

1   |   0000:x61; [This wirtes out 'a' and the order code is 1]
2   |   
3   |
4   |   0000:x62 [This writes out 'b' and the order code is 2]
5   |   0003:#1 [This has the order code of 3, this jump to order code 1, thus making a loop]
6   |
7   |
8   |
9   |
10  |   

Syntax:

Comments:
